9) What is a Cell Address in Excel?

                     A1: Refers to the cell located in column A and row 1.
                     B5: Refers to the cell located in Column B and row 5.

10) Explain the difference between a relative reference and an absolute reference in a formula.

         -> Realtaive Reference
    -------------------------------
          1) A relative reference changes when the formula is copied.
          2) It adjusts with the movement of Rows and Columns.
          3) Useful for applying same formula acress multiple cells.
          4) If the original formula in A1 is "=B1+C1" and is cpoied to A2, it gets adjusted to "=B2+C2"
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          -> Absolute Reference
    -------------------------------
          1) An absolute reference remains fixed.
          2) It doesnot adjust with movement of Rows and Columns.
          3) Useful for referencing a specific cell that should not change.
          4) If the original formula in A1 is "=$B$1+$C$1" and copied to A2, it remains as "=$B$1+$C$1".

11) What is the order of operations in Excel formulas?

          -> The order of operations in Eaxcel formulas is
                -> Parentheses
                -> Exponents
                -> Multiplication and Division (left to right)
                -> Addition and Subtraction (left to right)


12) What is the difference between Formula and Functions in Excel?

          -> Formula
             -> A formula isa user-defined expression that performs calculations using operations and references.
             -> Created manually by the user using operators like +,-,*, etc.
             -> =A1+B1-C1
             -> Can range from simple to complex based on user-defined logic.
             -> Fully customizable and can include functions.
             -> Performs basis or custom calculations
             -> Requires manual entry and logic setup.

          -> Function
             -> A fuction is a pre-built operation in Excel designed to perform specific tasks.
             -> Predefined in Excel, called by entering the function name (eg. =SUM, =AVERAGE)
             -> =SUM(A1:A10) or -IF(A1>10, "YES","NO")
             -> Often simplifies complex operations into single commands
             -> Limited to the structure and purpose of the predefined function.
             -> Simplifies repetitive or complex taska with predefined logic.
             -> Easy to use with predefined syntax and arguments.
